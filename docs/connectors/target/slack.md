# Slack Target
The Slack Target Connector enables you to send data from Popsink directly into Slack channels. This integration is useful for keeping teams informed in real time by streaming relevant data, alerts, or updates into their Slack workspace. You can configure the connector to post messages, update existing messages, or trigger specific Slack workflows based on the incoming data. It's particularly valuable for teams that use Slack for collaboration, incident management, or real-time communication.
