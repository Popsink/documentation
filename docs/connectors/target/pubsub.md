The Pubsub Target Connector enables data streaming from Popsink to a Pub/Sub messaging system, such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub or a similar publish-subscribe service. This connector facilitates real-time data distribution by allowing you to publish messages or events to a specific topic or channel within the Pub/Sub system. By configuring this connector, you can ensure that data from Popsink is delivered in near real-time to subscribers or downstream systems. It's particularly useful for applications requiring asynchronous data processing, event-driven architectures, or scalable message distribution.
