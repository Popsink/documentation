# CosmosDB Target
The CosmosDB Target Connector facilitates seamless integration with Azure Cosmos DB, Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service. This connector enables real-time streaming of data from Popsink into Cosmos DB containers, supporting various APIs including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table. It handles automatic schema mapping, data type conversion, and can create or update containers as needed. The CosmosDB connector is particularly valuable for applications requiring low-latency data access at global scale, such as IoT telemetry, real-time analytics, and personalization engines. It allows organizations to leverage Cosmos DB's multi-region writes, automatic indexing, and flexible consistency models while maintaining efficient data pipelines from diverse sources through Popsink. This connector is ideal for businesses looking to build highly responsive and globally distributed applications with real-time data synchronization capabilities.
