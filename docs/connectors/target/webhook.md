The WebHook Target Connector allows you to push data from Popsink to a specified webhook URL. This integration is designed for real-time data delivery to external services or applications that can accept HTTP POST requests. By setting up this connector, you can direct data from Popsink to the webhook endpoint, triggering events or updates based on the incoming data. This is particularly useful for integrating with third-party systems, automating workflows, or sending notifications and alerts to external platforms.
