# IBMi (AS/400) Source
The IBMi (AS/400) Source Connector integrates with IBM i, formerly known as IBM AS/400 and iSeries, a powerful and reliable midrange computer system widely used in enterprise environments. This connector enables the extraction and streaming of data from IBMi systems, which are known for hosting critical business applications and databases in industries such as manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. It allows organizations to tap into their legacy IBMi data, including information from DB2 for i databases and various file systems. By connecting IBMi to modern data pipelines, this connector facilitates data modernization efforts, enabling real-time analytics, cross-platform data integration, and the ability to leverage legacy data in cloud-based or hybrid environments. This is particularly valuable for organizations looking to modernize their data infrastructure while maintaining their investments in IBMi systems.
